                <h1>about myself</h1>
                <p> My real name is Daniel, im 16 years old, 
                live in los angeles, and love taking photos.
                I have been taking photos for over 2 years,
                capturing places, people, and nature. I first 
                got introduced to photography by my dad. I was 
                somewhat familiar with photography because I 
                have always been into making videos. The way 
                i discovered more about photography was when 
                my sister was born. Around that time my dad 
                took us to the swamp meet to go look around. 
                He had borrowed a camera from one of my uncles, 
                which he then gave to me and told me to take 
                pictures. After the day i really enjoyed looking 
                back and viewing the photos i took, ranking them, 
                and sharing them. Since then i have found a 
                passion in photography, a passion that i will
                have forever...
